Interpreting user needs and implementing them into a program involves actively engaging with users to comprehend their 
requirements and preferences. This understanding is translated into the development process through methods like creating 
"user stories." These concise, user-focused descriptions articulate what a user wants and why, helping keep the user's needs 
central during development. When approaching program development, I aim to incorporate agile processes like Scrum or Kanban. 
These methodologies promote iterative development, allowing for flexibility and responsiveness to changes, ensuring that the 
program aligns closely with evolving user needs. Being a valuable team member in software development entails effective 
communication, collaboration, adaptability, strong problem-solving abilities, and fostering a supportive team environment, 
enabling the team to deliver high-quality solutions while staying responsive to user requirements and changes in the 
development landscape.
